                            In today's tutorial, we'll walk through the process of designing a responsive footer using HTML and CSS.
                            A footer is an essential element of any website as it provides important information and navigation
                            links to users. We'll start by understanding the basic concepts of a footer and then dive into the code
                            to create one that is easy to use, even for beginners.

                        <h3>Understanding the Footer Concept</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before we dive into the code, let's understand the purpose of a footer. A footer typically appears at
                            the bottom of a webpage and contains important information such as company details, related links,
                            contact information, and social media links. It serves as a navigational aid and enhances the overall
                            user experience.
