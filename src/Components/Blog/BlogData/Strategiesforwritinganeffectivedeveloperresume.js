                        <h3>Tailor Your Resume for Each Job:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Understand the Job Description:</span> Analyze the job description carefully. Note the specific skills, technologies, and experience they require.</li>
                            <li><span>Highlight Relevant Skills:</span> Showcase the skills and technologies that match the job description, even if they're not listed in the "Skills" section.</li>
                            <li><span>Use Keywords from the Job Description:</span> Incorporate keywords directly from the job description into your resume to ensure your resume is picked up by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
